# COTA Text Parser

This is my solution to a code test given to me by COTA.

To run, you must have npm and Chrome installed.

Once npm is installed, navigate to the COTA Text Parser root folder in a terminal, type 'npm install' and hit the Enter key.

The COTA Text Parser code is in the scripts/textParser.js file.

To run the unit tests, type 'npm test' from the COTA Text Parser root folder and hit the Enter key.
